- Consider SEO sites: content related (blog, news)
- Don't care about SEO sites: can't access by anonymous (admin interface / forum / social (facebook))

---

## CSR's drawbacks

- SEO not friendly
- blank first screen (demo)

---

## Demo webpacker

- Gemfile webpacker
- bin/rails webpacker:install
- bin/rails webpacker:install:react
- implement SSR / CSR examples


```
bin/rails g model Movie cover_img:string title:string desc:text
bin/rails g controller Movies ssr csr
```

---

## Demo use npm package

- react-stars

---

## Demo blank first screen and workaround

---

## Demo react-rails to support SSR for react

- bin/rails g react:install

---
